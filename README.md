Summary:
========

This web-based application enables users to search and filter adverse reactions related to the intake of specific drugs based off publicly-available FDA Drug Incident Reports. The goal is to both help people understand what adverse reactions may occur and arm them with information to ask the right questions to their medical providers. The application consumes a public API of drug interactions and provides a robust means of searching one or more drugs, while displaying potential reactions in an easy-to-understand collection of graphics, tables and references to NIH definitions of drugs and reactions.

About Ventera
=============

 

Ventera Corporation is a small business, delivering high-value technology outcomes to both the private sector and the federal government for nearly two decades. Two of our largest federal clients—the USDA Food and Nutrition Service and the Department of Homeland Security—have embraced our Agile Scrum methodology as a proven means of ensuring valuable, user-centric solutions.

 

Project Approach
================

When the RFQ was released, the selected Product Manager, Swati Khandewale, had the authority to make both budget and implementation decisions regarding the prototype.

 

The Product Owner (PO) team used a lean approach when initially presented with the RFQ prompt. The first step in that approach involved defining both a problem hypothesis and a customer hypothesis. Assumptions surrounding those hypotheses were then validated or invalidated through analysis of data provided in OpenFDA APIs and conversations with potential users. Our team then determined a goal for the prototype and concluded a high-level user story:

 

As a concerned patient, family member, or friend, I want access to information in past FDA Drug Incident Reports so that I am aware of patient drug reactions.

 

Personas were identified to ensure that user stories developed for the prototype addressed specific user needs.  Detailed user stories and tasks were created in a[ ](https://github.com/akulasainath/18frepo/issues)[Product Backlog](https://github.com/akulasainath/18frepo/issues).  Each user story was prioritized to ensure that the most impactful items were completed first.

 

The team decided Kanban was a more appropriate Agile methodology for a project with the time constraint (Ventera usually employs a Scrum approach).  Kanban allowed Ventera to deliver value quickly while minimizing waste. Frequent user story prioritization ensured that every feature added to the prototype provided value.

The discovery phase allowed the Technical Team to determine the application’s architecture and technical stack and also provided the PO team with the opportunity to ensure that the Technical Team was aligned with project goals and objectives.  The PO team elaborated the highest priority user stories for the initial iteration. A designer worked with both teams to create wireframes for the initial implementation approach.

The Ventera team applied many Agile best practices from a technical perspective.

The team’s key area of focus was to achieve a “quick win” from the first iteration.

●          Agile Tenet \#3: Value customer collaboration over contract negotiation: A user survey was created to solicit and incorporate feedback from potential users outside of the team in order to full understand what people need.
